EVM Compatible Blockchain Transaction Decoder

ðŸš§ Welcome to Dexode's update repo, where I'll be reporting on project progress and uploading the main repo files. ðŸš§

# Backstory

As a user of many EVM compatible blockchains and DeFi web apps I understand how disorganised and confusing wallet transactions can seem. The ability
to track and understand your transactions, and make sure balances are up to date and accurate, and have access to coin and token prices ("pricestamps")
at the time of each transaction is essential for calculating profit, loss, and reporting taxes such as capital gains and income tax. Dexode was built as
a tool to help achieve this.

Dexode's key driving factors and features include:

* No servers please. All blockchain related data is obtained from the clients IP and crunched locally. The server acts simply to deliver the web app.
* No servers please. Your data, like your keys and crypto, is yours. Curate your transactions with Dexode and export your data locally. Keep it safe to avoid resyncing later. Load back in at any time.
* Connects via web3 wallet to obtain wallet account details.
* Connect to Archive Nodes for archive node balances.
* Learn about DeFi and what appears on the blockchain as you curate your transactions.
* Visualise pricestamps over time.
* Compute profit and loss, and product capital gains and income tax reports.
* 

Hopefully one day I will actually need to ï¿½le my tax report for crypto assets, and I realise how difï¿½cult that could be given the current tools. There are some tax reporting systems out there already, which didn't particularly work well for me.
My main drivers are that the user should be in control of their transaction history and data, and I designed Dexode to work client-side, so there's no user data stored on the server. The server just delivers the web app.
The address I provided in the "Website" text box will take you to the web app, but it might be better to start with the video demo here to get a good understanding of what Dexode is:
