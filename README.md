# Dexode
EVM Compatible Blockchain Transaction Decoder

ðŸš§ Welcome to Dexode's update repo, where I'll be reporting on project progress and uploading the main repo files. ðŸš§

# Background

As a user of many EVM compatible blockchains and DeFi web apps I understand how disorganised and confusing wallet transactions can seem. The ability
to track and understand your transactions, and make sure balances are up to date and accurate, and have access to coin and token prices ("pricestamps")
at the time of each transaction is essential for calculating profit, loss, and reporting taxes such as capital gains and income tax. Dexode was built as
a tool to help achieve this.

Dexode's key driving factors and features include:

* All blockchain related data is obtained from the clients IP and crunched locally. The server acts simply to deliver the web app.
* Your data, like your keys and crypto, is yours. Curate your transactions with Dexode and export your data locally. Keep it safe to avoid resyncing later. Load back in at any time.
* Connects via web3 wallet to obtain wallet account details.
* Connect to Archive Nodes for archive node balances.
* Learn about DeFi and what appears on the blockchain as you curate your transactions.
* Visualise pricestamps over time.
* Compute profit and loss, and produce capital gains and income tax reports.
